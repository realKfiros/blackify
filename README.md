# blackify
Compress files into archives and insert the archives to qr code
```shell
npx blackify
```

## Why is it called blackify?
I work with a closed network, and if we want to put material inside that network, we call this action to "whiten", and because this utility does the opposite but not in the same way, instead of blacked I gave it the name blackify.
